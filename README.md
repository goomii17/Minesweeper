### About this project

This is a simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game in Javascript. It includes a bot that can play one turn at a time and
an option to let it play automatically. The bot speed can be adjusted with the framerate buttons.  
When you finish a game, or when you get tired, you can click the "Ranom" button to generate a new game.
